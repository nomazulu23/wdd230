            <img class="img_vis" src="images2/Honey2.jpeg" alt="Visual Hierarchy">
            <p>Nielsen Norman Group noted that Summary: A clear visual hierarchy guides the eye to the most important elements on the page.
            It can be created through variations in color and contrast, scale, and grouping. A website with a good visual design
            allows the user to have a clear sense of direction. The eye is guided to consume each different elements. 
        Good visual hierarchy can be created using, color and contract, scale and grouping. The Honey Fashion and Accessories
        makes use of color and contrast. The colors used grab attention. The use of lighter and darker colors balance each other.
        The title and the heading are in bold and lighter color grabing attention and the information is in smaller font size and darker. 
        The sizes of font provide enough variety to clearly see the headings and text content. The title is the largest, the headings are 
        medium size and the text content is smaller. This keeps the hierarchical relationship well defined and clear.

            <img class="img_wht" src="images2/Water Works.jpeg" alt="White Space and Clean">
            <p>White Space and Clean Design allows the design to breathe by reducing too much text and funstional elements that the user 
                interacts with. The beauty of white space and clean design is that is make text to be clear and readable. It also guides
                the eye. According to Nick Babich he noted that White space has a tremendous impact on how people comprehend information
                because content relationships are defined by surrounding negative space. The water works website looks clean and neat. 
                The white space clearly brings our the beautiful design. The page is not too busy. We see the connection of the title and the 
                headings. White space drive user's attention to a particular object. In this case, the website drives the user to pay attention 
                to the images of the beautiful taps without having to worry about reading alot of text.
